# CERN copy of jupyterhub helm chart

This is taken from: https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s

It includes the jupyterhub directory only, and to automate with the rest of the
gitlab-ci helm chart / repo integration we do not mirror the upstream repo,
just copy.

At some point we should improve this so we can mirror directly.
